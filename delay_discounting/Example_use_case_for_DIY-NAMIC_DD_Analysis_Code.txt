The files in this folder were generated using raw data from the administration of paradigm P6-2 of the DIY-NAMIC discounting task, analyzed using the DIY-NAMIC-Analysis-For-DD code. They represent an example use case for both the general metrics and latency analysis functions of the code. 


----- 

Parameters used to analyze the example use case: 
- analysis bin size (hours): 23
- residual time bin size (hours): 15
- Do you also want to export latency data?: y

Raw Files used in the example analysis can be found in the "Example_DIY-NAMIC_Analysis_RawData" folder.
